# RFC: Improving Validator Testnet Experience

## Motivation
Validator candidates require repeated testing of staking, delegation, redelegation, and unbonding flows.
Compared to regular testnet users, validators naturally consume more testnet tokens during setup and verification.

Improving the validator testnet experience can lead to higher-quality feedback and stronger network security before mainnet.

## Observations from Validator Setup
During validator setup and testing, the following patterns are commonly observed:
- Validator testing often requires multiple iterations of stake and delegation transactions.
- Faucet limits that are sufficient for regular users may restrict deeper validator testing.
- Manual token distribution can increase operational overhead for the team.

## Possible Approaches (Non-Prescriptive)
This section does not propose a single solution, but outlines potential approaches worth discussion:
- Validator-tagged faucet allowances with higher limits.
- Time-based testnet token allowances for validator candidates.
- Manual or semi-automated top-ups tied to validator registration.

## Expected Benefits
Improving validator-focused testnet flows may result in:
- More comprehensive validator test coverage.
- Reduced manual support requests.
- Higher-quality feedback from experienced operators.
- Stronger testnet signal before mainnet launch.

## Closing Notes
This document is intended as an open discussion starter based on real validator testing experience.
Feedback and alternative approaches are welcome.
